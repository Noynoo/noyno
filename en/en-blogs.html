        — The Correct Way to Approach Experts

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        
        <p>In our studies and work, we inevitably encounter various difficulties. Out of a humble and eager-to-learn attitude, many people choose to consult industry experts. However, oftentimes our questions receive no response or are directly ignored. Is this because the experts are arrogant and conceited? Not necessarily,experts are usually willing to help others，the root of the problem may lie in the way and content of our questions.</p>

        <h2>I. Why Do Experts Not Respond?</h2>
        <p>Experts have valuable time and are usually busy handling complex problems and projects. If we ask questions that can be solved by ourselves through a bit of searching or effort, we are essentially wasting both parties' time.</p>
        <p>As Eric Steven Raymond, a notable figure in hacker culture, pointed out in "How to Ask Questions the Smart Way": "Before asking others, try to find the answer yourself. This is a respect for others' time and a way to improve your own abilities."</p>

        <h2>II. Categorize Your Questions</h2>
        <p>Before asking, we need to learn to categorize our questions to choose the most appropriate solution strategy.
</p>
        <p>Self-resolvable issues: I refer to them as "General Knowledge Questions," which are typically questions with clear answers that can be resolved independently through search engines, document reviews, or tutorials. For example, the installation steps for a software program or the basic definition of a certain concept.</p>
        <p>Research-Intensive Questions: These may involve complex background knowledge and require time to delve deeply. You might need to read professional books, academic papers, or attend relevant courses. These are considered complex problems or advanced topics.</p>
        <p>The real question that needs to be asked is: difficult problems that cannot be solved through self-effort. Such questions are worth consulting with experts, but when asking, it is necessary to provide sufficient background information and the solutions that have already been tried.</p>

        <h2>III. "If You Don't Know, Ask" or "If You Don't Know, Search"?</h2>
        <p>Traditional wisdom advocates "If you don't know, ask," but in the era of information explosion, "If you don't know, search" might be a more effective approach. The development of search engines and AI technology has made obtaining information more convenient than ever.</p>
        <p>Albert Einstein once said, "The formulation of a problem is often more essential than its solution."However, the premise of this statement is that we need to have the ability to raise high-quality questions. This ability is cultivated through continuous self-learning and exploration.</p>

        <h2>IV. How to Properly Approach Experts</h2>
        <p>Self-Help First: Before asking, ensure you have tried to solve the problem through various means, including search engines, official documentation, and forums.</p>
        <p>Be Clear and Specific: Clearly describe the background of the problem, specific symptoms, and the solutions you have already attempted.</p>
        <p>Polite and Respectful: Use courteous language to express your appreciation for others' time and assistance.</p>
        <p>Avoid Repetition: Check if the question has already been asked by others to avoid redundancy.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Learning to ask questions properly is a respect for others' time and a pathway to self-improvement. In today's rapidly advancing information technology era, we should make better use of tools to solve problems independently. Transitioning from "If you don't know, ask" to "If you don't know, search" is the trend of the times and a necessary journey for personal growth.
